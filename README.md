Note: raw alpha, very jank

This tini-tiny app - ~35-50 mb of ram, lets you close all open windows except allowlisted ones with a keyboard shortcut anywhere. Ctrl+Alt+J by default.

It mimics the behavior of closing a window with the X button so you shouldn't worry about unsaved things, the "you have unsaved changes" pop-up if one is present that is, should save you.

Imagine the situation, you opened 40 different applications, you're doomed, you were just coding or video editing or something, now you have to close each one, dare god restart your pc. But here comes a time saver. Just kill them all, one shortcut - anytime, just for you.

Made in Rust with egui and eframe.

Works on Windows and just Windows nothing else (*yet*, if I finish it)
